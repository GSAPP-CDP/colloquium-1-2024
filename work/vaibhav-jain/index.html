        <h1 id="assignment-2">2 – Authorship</h1>
        <h2>2a - Authorship Philosophy - Filmaking</h2>
        <p>My authorship philosophy revolves around the concept of authorship in the digital age, particularly in the context of filmmaking. I believe that authorship is a powerful tool for expression and creativity, and its dynamics have been profoundly altered by technological advancements. In this landscape, it's crucial to consider how authorship empowers various stakeholders and the responsibilities that come with it. </p>
      </section>


      
      <section>
          <h2>Authorship and Power Dynamics</h2>
        <p>The act of authoring is intrinsically linked to power. In filmmaking, the director often holds significant control over the creative vision, but with the advent of collaborative tools and platforms, this power is more distributed. For example, platforms like YouTube democratize content creation, allowing anyone with a camera to become a filmmaker. This shift empowers a broader range of voices but also raises questions about the ownership and credit of content. </p>
      </section>
      
      <section>
        <h2>Stakeholders and Flexibility</h2>
      <p>Considering the stakeholders in my system, such as filmmakers, audiences, and content platforms, it's essential to balance "lock-in" and flexibility. Jaron Lanier's concept of "lock-in" refers to the rigidity imposed by certain technologies, which can be both beneficial and limiting. For expert filmmakers, a high degree of control and customization in editing software is crucial, while non-experts benefit from more guided, flexible tools that simplify the creation process. Thus, my approach to authorship should cater to varying levels of expertise, offering robust features for seasoned professionals and intuitive interfaces for novices. </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Crediting and Copyright</h2>
    <p>In the realm of generative tools and AI, the issue of crediting becomes complex. AI-generated content raises questions about authorship and ownership. I believe that creators who use AI tools should be credited for their input and creativity, while acknowledging the role of the AI and the data it was trained on. AI itself should not hold copyrights, but the original authors of the data used to train AI models should be recognized. This ensures fair attribution and maintains the integrity of creative works. </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Responsibility and Accountability</h2>
  <p>Being an author comes with significant responsibilities. Filmmakers and content creators should be accountable for the authenticity and originality of their work. Platforms hosting user-generated content should implement mechanisms to ensure proper crediting and to prevent plagiarism. Users, businesses, and technology developers must all adhere to ethical standards, promoting transparency and respect for intellectual property. </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Control and Empowerment</h2>
<p>Control in my practice should be distributed among various stakeholders. Filmmakers should have control over their creative processes, while audiences should have the power to interact with and critique content. Platforms should facilitate this interaction while maintaining ethical standards. For instance, collaborative tools should enable multiple authors to contribute while tracking individual contributions, ensuring everyone receives proper credit. </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Examples of Authorship Models</h2>
        <section>
      <ul>
        <li><a id="Youtube : ">1 – Democratization of Filmmaking through Platforms:</a></li><p>Platforms like YouTube have democratized filmmaking by allowing anyone with a camera and internet access to share their work with a global audience. This shift has redistributed the power traditionally held by major studios and distributors. While it empowers a diverse range of voices to contribute to the cinematic landscape, it also raises questions about content ownership and credit. For example, a filmmaker using a low-budget setup can create viral content that challenges established norms, reflecting the new dynamics of authorship and power in the digital age.
        </p>
        <li><a id="Github : ">2 – Balancing Expertise and Accessibility in Editing Software:</a></li><p>Editing software such as Adobe Premiere Pro offers advanced features for professional filmmakers, allowing for detailed control and customization of their projects. In contrast, simpler tools like iMovie cater to novices by providing guided, user-friendly interfaces. This distinction aligns with Jaron Lanier's concept of "lock-in," where experts benefit from sophisticated options while beginners use more accessible tools. By offering varying levels of functionality, these tools support a range of expertise, reflecting a balanced approach to flexibility and control in authorship.
        </p>
        <li><a id="Are.na : ">3 – AI in Screenwriting and Its Impact on Crediting:</a></li><p>The use of AI tools like ChatGPT in screenwriting raises complex issues regarding authorship and crediting. For instance, if a script is generated with the assistance of an AI, the human author who provided the initial input and guidance should be credited, while acknowledging the AI's role in developing the content. This approach ensures fair attribution of creative contributions and maintains the integrity of the work. By recognizing the contributions of both the human and the AI, this model addresses the challenges of ownership and creativity in the era of generative tools.

            <h1 id="assignment-3">3 – Politics</h1>
            <h2>3a - Politics - Encroachment of Private Spaces into Urban Public Areas</h2>
            <p>My future practice revolves around addressing the intrusion of private spaces into public realms, such as cafes encroaching on pedestrian walkways, public plazas, and cycling paths. The types of data that resonate most with my practice include location coordinates, images, interview quotes, text reviews, and ratings. Location data (both lat/lon and addresses) help pinpoint specific areas of encroachment. Images capture visual evidence of the intrusion, while interview quotes provide firsthand accounts of its impact on pedestrians and cyclists. Text reviews and ratings offer public sentiment and highlight recurring issues.<p>
              <p>The datasets shed light on the "pain points" by illustrating the frequency and severity of encroachments. They support my hypothesis by revealing patterns of intrusion and public dissatisfaction. Finding this data was relatively straightforward due to the prevalence of location-based services and online review platforms. However, the data is not exhaustive and may miss subtle or less-reported instances of intrusion.<p>
              <p>The politics of data collection can influence its accuracy and representation. Data collected by business owners may downplay negative impacts, whereas data from affected individuals might emphasize them. Some methods, like interviews, offer a personal narrative, while geolocation data provides an overarching view. I am drawn to datasets that balance quantitative precision with qualitative depth, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the issue. Addressing data gaps may involve conducting surveys or deploying sensors to gather unbiased, firsthand data. <p>

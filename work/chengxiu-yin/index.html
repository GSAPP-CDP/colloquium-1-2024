        <h2>What is the system?</h2>
        <p>
          The integration of AI technology has significantly enriched traditional education frameworks, enhancing
          connections between individuals and vast information. This approach facilitates more effective engagement with
          information, strengthening the learner’s ability to interact, absorb, and apply knowledge. I am particularly
          interested in how AI can transform BFA students into explorers of computational design.

        <h2>Feedback Loops:</h2>

        <p>
          The system dynamics involve multiple feedback loops. A reinforcing feedback loop occurs when students use
          ChatGPT for idea generation, leading to more innovative projects and further use of the tool. However,
          over-reliance on ChatGPT can stifle creativity, prompting a balancing feedback loop that encourage independent
          work.
        </p>

        <section>
          <h2>Stocks, Flows, and Delays: </h2>

          <p>
            students’ accumulated knowledge and creativity, while flows include continuous input of ideas and feedback
            from ChatGPT and other stakeholders. Frequency and delay are evident in ChatGPT’s response times and
            students’ integration of feedback. My diagrams illustrate a streamlined human-AI collaboration design
            process, highlighting the importance of managing delays for effective learning outcomes.

        <section>
          <h2>Leverage Points and Hierarchy:</h2>

          <p>
            Key leverage points include the availability and quality of ChatGPT feedback. Enhancing these can
            significantly improve system efficiency. The hierarchy comprises individual students, interactions with
            classmates and professors, and integration into the broader art community. Boundaries are defined by
            ChatGPT’s current limitations and its role in art education.
          </p>

          <section>
            <h2>Resilience:</h2>

            <p>
              As students keep their professional strengths without being overshadowed by AI, adapting to new
              technologies and methods to ensure continuous support for their creative processes. By optimizing these
              elements, feedback loops, and leverage points, this system can greatly enhance the educational experience
              for BFA students transitioning to computational design.

            <h1 id="assignment-2">2 – Authorship</h1>
            <h2>Authorship Philosophy in AI-Enhanced Design School Students in CAFA to create projects</h2>

            <p>To be more specific, the system focuses on how students at the Central Academy of Fine Arts' School of
              Design
              complete their portfolios, particularly integrating generative AI into various stages of creation:
              inspiration, research, analysis, workflow, framework building, technical implementation, visual
              presentation,
              drawing, and layout. Peers and professors are broadly defined as fellow graduate applicants and portfolio
              advisors.</p>

            <p>I believe AI itself does not hold copyright, as within my system, few would use AI-generated content
              (AIGC)
              without modifications. Images, videos, and text generated by AI require refinement and personal input.
              Creators should be responsible for the content they generate. In this system, authorship levels are
              defined by
              the understanding of generative AI:</p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Mass Authors</strong>: Undergraduates (especially before junior year) who may use AI tools
                with
                less customization.</li>
              <li><strong>User Authors</strong>: Applicants in the application season who use AI tools extensively and
                customize their outputs.</li>
              <li><strong>Program Authors</strong>: Computer science professionals who might develop agents and
                customize
                fine-tuning for this system.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Control within the system follows a hierarchical model where increased capability comes with greater
              responsibility.</p>

            <h3>Lock-in and Flexibility</h3>

            <p>In my system, the "lock-in" lies in the reliance on prompt engineering. This ensures that all
              stakeholders do
              not need to achieve breakthrough innovations but can work within the framework to create meaningful
              content—akin to the 3% principle proposed by former LV director Virgil Abloh, where slight variations lead
              to
              significant impact.</p>

            <h3>Comparison of Leading LLMs</h3>

            <p>In the past 10 years, Pinterest has been the primary platform for Design school students in CAFA seeking
              image inspiration. Whether high school students looking for artworks to study or those focused on
              portfolio
              creation in my system, Pinterest's strength lies in its ability to refine search results through
              image-to-image tag similarities. This approach is ideal for visual workers and remains relevant even with
              the
              advent of Generative AI-LLM.</p>

            <h4>ChatGPT-4</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Strengths</strong>: Widely recognized for its robust conversational abilities, extensive
                training
                data, and adaptability across different tasks.</li>
              <li><strong>Authorship Model</strong>: Encourages user customization and interaction, allowing for
                significant
                user input and modification.</li>
              <li><strong>Lock-in</strong>: Effective in creating a consistent and reliable interaction model but may
                limit
                innovative uses due to its predefined structures.</li>
              <li><strong>Personal Experience</strong>: Best for everyday use and text-related tasks due to its
                multimodal
                capabilities.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Claude 3.5</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Strengths</strong>: Known for its ability to handle more complex tasks and nuanced
                conversations,
                often used in specialized applications.</li>
              <li><strong>Authorship Model</strong>: Provides a balance between user customization and automated
                suggestions, suitable for users with varying levels of expertise.</li>
              <li><strong>Lock-in</strong>: Provides a flexible framework for users but may encounter limitations in
                areas
                requiring high specificity and control.</li>
              <li><strong>Personal Experience</strong>: Best for coding capabilities, suitable for beginners exploring
                the
                computational design field.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Google Gemini Advanced</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Strengths</strong>: Integrates seamlessly with Google’s ecosystem, offering powerful tools for
                research and information retrieval.</li>
              <li><strong>Authorship Model</strong>: Emphasizes ease of use and accessibility, making it suitable for
                both
                novice and expert users.</li>
              <li><strong>Lock-in</strong>: Highly flexible, allowing for broad applications, but may lead to dependency
                on
                Google’s ecosystem and tools.</li>
              <li><strong>Personal Experience</strong>: Ideal as a learning aid, especially after coming to the U.S.,
                when
                used within the Google ecosystem.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>By balancing lock-in and flexibility, creating technologies that support innovation while maintaining
              reliability and user trust is possible. Considering the diverse needs of different user groups and
              fostering a
              model of authorship that encourages creativity and ethical use can greatly enhance the educational
              experience
              for students transitioning to computational design.</p>

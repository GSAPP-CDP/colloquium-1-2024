      The study of New York City’s urban heat effect requires a comprehensive understanding of the city’s development over time. 
      By examining the city’s historical periods and identifying prominent buildings, we can better understand how architectural 
      and urban planning decisions have contributed to or mitigated the urban heat effect. Different phases of New York’s development 
      saw varying architectural styles, building materials, and urban densities, all of which play significant roles in the city’s 
      thermal environment. Analyzing these historical contexts and the buildings that define them allows us to pinpoint specific factors 
      that influent heat retention in the urban landscape.

            <h1>1 – Systems</h1>
          
            <h2>What is the system?</h2>
            <p>
              The integration of AI technology has significantly enriched traditional education frameworks, enhancing
              connections between individuals and vast information. This approach facilitates more effective engagement with
              information, strengthening the learner’s ability to interact, absorb, and apply knowledge. I am particularly
              interested in how AI can transform BFA students into explorers of computational design.
            </p>

            </figure>
          
            <hr>
          
            <figure>
              <img src="diagram2.jpg">

            </figure>
          
            <hr>
          
            <h2>Feedback Loops:</h2>
            <p>
              The system dynamics involve multiple feedback loops. A reinforcing feedback loop occurs when students use
              ChatGPT for idea generation, leading to more innovative projects and further use of the tool. However,
              over-reliance on ChatGPT can stifle creativity, prompting a balancing feedback loop that encourage independent
              work.
            </p>
          
            <h2>Stocks, Flows, and Delays: </h2>
            <p>
              Students’ accumulated knowledge and creativity, while flows include continuous input of ideas and feedback
              from ChatGPT and other stakeholders. Frequency and delay are evident in ChatGPT’s response times and
              students’ integration of feedback. My diagrams illustrate a streamlined human-AI collaboration design
              process, highlighting the importance of managing delays for effective learning outcomes.
            </p>
          
            <h2>Leverage Points and Hierarchy:</h2>
            <p>
              Key leverage points include the availability and quality of ChatGPT feedback. Enhancing these can
              significantly improve system efficiency. The hierarchy comprises individual students, interactions with
              classmates and professors, and integration into the broader art community. Boundaries are defined by
              ChatGPT’s current limitations and its role in art education.
            </p>
          
            <h2>Resilience:</h2>
            <p>
              As students keep their professional strengths without being overshadowed by AI, adapting to new
              technologies and methods to ensure continuous support for their creative processes. By optimizing these
              elements, feedback loops, and leverage points, this system can greatly enhance the educational experience
              for BFA students transitioning to computational design.

        <h1>2 – Authorship</h1>
        <h2>Authorship Philosophy in AI-Enhanced Design School Students in CAFA to create projects</h2>

        <p>To be more specific, the system focuses on how students at the Central Academy of Fine Arts' School of Design
          complete their portfolios, particularly integrating generative AI into various stages of creation: inspiration,
          research, analysis, workflow, framework building, technical implementation, visual presentation, drawing, and
          layout. Peers and professors are broadly defined as fellow graduate applicants and portfolio advisors.</p>

        <p>I believe AI itself does not hold copyright, as within my system, few would use AI-generated content (AIGC)
          without modifications. Images, videos, and text generated by AI require refinement and personal input. Creators
          should be responsible for the content they generate. In this system, authorship levels are defined by the
          understanding of generative AI:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Mass Authors</strong>: Undergraduates (especially before junior year) who may use AI tools with
            less customization.</li>
          <li><strong>User Authors</strong>: Applicants in the application season who use AI tools extensively and
            customize their outputs.</li>
          <li><strong>Program Authors</strong>: Computer science professionals who might develop agents and customize
            fine-tuning for this system.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Control within the system follows a hierarchical model where increased capability comes with greater
          responsibility.</p>

        <h3>Lock-in and Flexibility</h3>

        <p>In my system, the "lock-in" lies in the reliance on prompt engineering. This ensures that all stakeholders do
          not need to achieve breakthrough innovations but can work within the framework to create meaningful
          content—akin to the 3% principle proposed by former LV director Virgil Abloh, where slight variations lead to
          significant impact.</p>

        <h3>Comparison of Leading LLMs</h3>

        <p>In the past 10 years, Pinterest has been the primary platform for Design school students in CAFA seeking image
          inspiration. Whether high school students looking for artworks to study or those focused on portfolio creation
          in my system, Pinterest's strength lies in its ability to refine search results through image-to-image tag
          similarities. This approach is ideal for visual workers and remains relevant even with the advent of Generative
          AI-LLM.</p>

        <h4>ChatGPT-4</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Strengths</strong>: Widely recognized for its robust conversational abilities, extensive training
            data, and adaptability across different tasks.</li>
          <li><strong>Authorship Model</strong>: Encourages user customization and interaction, allowing for significant
            user input and modification.</li>
          <li><strong>Lock-in</strong>: Effective in creating a consistent and reliable interaction model but may limit
            innovative uses due to its predefined structures.</li>
          <li><strong>Personal Experience</strong>: Best for everyday use and text-related tasks due to its multimodal
            capabilities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Claude 3.5</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Strengths</strong>: Known for its ability to handle more complex tasks and nuanced conversations,
            often used in specialized applications.</li>
          <li><strong>Authorship Model</strong>: Provides a balance between user customization and automated suggestions,
            suitable for users with varying levels of expertise.</li>
          <li><strong>Lock-in</strong>: Provides a flexible framework for users but may encounter limitations in areas
            requiring high specificity and control.</li>
          <li><strong>Personal Experience</strong>: Best for coding capabilities, suitable for beginners exploring the
            computational design field.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Google Gemini Advanced</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Strengths</strong>: Integrates seamlessly with Google’s ecosystem, offering powerful tools for
            research and information retrieval.</li>
          <li><strong>Authorship Model</strong>: Emphasizes ease of use and accessibility, making it suitable for both
            novice and expert users.</li>
          <li><strong>Lock-in</strong>: Highly flexible, allowing for broad applications, but may lead to dependency on
            Google’s ecosystem and tools.</li>
          <li><strong>Personal Experience</strong>: Ideal as a learning aid, especially after coming to the U.S., when
            used within the Google ecosystem.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>By balancing lock-in and flexibility, creating technologies that support innovation while maintaining
          reliability and user trust is possible. Considering the diverse needs of different user groups and fostering a
          model of authorship that encourages creativity and ethical use can greatly enhance the educational experience
          for students transitioning to computational design.</p>

            <h1 id="animated-text">As we all know, urbanization and urban development have significantly influenced trees, for this process requires the removal of large green spaces for the construction of buildings, roads, and other infrastructure. Development of city has such an impact on trees that when it comes to tree destruction, people immediately think of urbanization. But, does the urban development really deserve the blame for all the destruction?</h1>

        <div class="draggable content-wrapper_2" id="draggable-box">
            <h1>Location is also important. Trees thrive when planted in the right location. For the environmental factors have a great impact on trees. Spending some time thinking through the locations where trees are planted will determine the vigor and lifespan of those trees.</h1>
            <h1>Here are some types of trees and the environment that suitable for them to live in.</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="draggable content-wrapper_3" id="draggable-box">
            <h1>I'm not saying this in defense of the development of cities. It does destroy a lot of trees for development. But there are various reasons for the health of trees, and sometimes tree degradation is not directly related to urbanization. I hope that people will not just focus on urban development and ignore other factors. Here are some factors that also have a greater impact on the health of trees.</h1>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>One important thing is Biological Competition. Competition between trees or with other vegetation, especially in resource-limited environments, can impact a tree’s access to sunlight, water, and nutrients, thus affecting its health.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="draggable content-wrapper_4">
            <h1>And the Pests and Pathogens. Pests (such as beetles and the pinewood nematode) and pathogens (like fungi and bacteria) can cause diseases in trees, potentially leading to severe damage or death.</h1>
            <p>Spotted lanternfly, an invasive insect that poses a significant threat to a variety of trees and plants in New York and other regions of the United States. Repeated feeding by large numbers of Spotted Lanternflies can stress trees, leading to reduced vigor and overall health decline.</p>
            <p> Gypsy Moth, another common invasive species. The larvae (caterpillars) of the gypsy moth consume large quantities of tree leaves, leading to nutrient deficiencies. Severe defoliation can cause stunted growth, leaf drop, and even tree death. Besides, Affected trees are more susceptible to diseases and other pests.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="draggable content-wrapper_5">
            <p>At last, extreme weather events, such as frequent droughts, heavy rains, extreme high or low temperatures, and other extreme weather events which can put significant stress on trees and affect their health.</p>
            <p>High winds during storms can break branches, strip leaves, and even uproot entire trees, and Severe wind can result in the loss of a significant portion of a tree's canopy. Prolonged drought deprives trees of the necessary water to maintain their physiological processes. This can lead to wilting, leaf browning, and in severe cases, tree death, and Drought-stressed trees are more susceptible to pest infestations. Intense heat from wildfires can scorch the bark, damaging the cambium layer.</p>

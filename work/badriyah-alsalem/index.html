        <h2>What is the system?</h2>
        <h3>Energy Supply Systems in Underdeveloped Countries</h3>
        <p>
          So initially in the reading I went with something that aligns with what a system is much more clearly, and I
          went with energy supply systems, which offer clear documented systems and structures, and decided to specify
          that even further where it applies to underdeveloped countries.
        </p>

        <p>
          This system is very important because its existence is what ensures reliable and sustainable energy to poor
          areas, which obviously will greatly improve living standards and help with economic development.
        </p>

        <p>
          The energy supply system has a very clear structure. First, we have energy generation, which includes power
          plants like solar, wind, hydro, and fossil fuels. These power plants are where energy is made. Next comes
          the distribution part, which involves transmission lines and local networks that carry energy to where it's
          needed. Then, we have the consumption part, which includes homes, businesses, and public services that use
          the energy. Lastly, there's maintenance, which keeps everything running well.
        </p>

        <p>
          In this system, we can understand it as a balance of stocks and flows. Stocks are reserves of energy, like
          batteries and fossil fuels, and infrastructure like power plants and transmission lines. Flows are the rates
          at which energy is produced and used, as well as the money invested in energy infrastructure.
        </p>

        <p>
          Feedback loops play a big role in this system. A reinforcing feedback loop happens when more energy access
          leads to more economic activities, making more money that can be reinvested in energy projects. This creates
          a positive cycle of improvement. A balancing feedback loop involves maintenance and support systems that
          ensure stability and stop infrastructure from breaking down, keeping the energy supply steady. But upon
          further understanding, this system faces several problems.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are:
          Physical Constraints: Hard to reach places, tough terrain, availability of resources.
          Technological Constraints: Access to modern tech, reliability of networks.
          Financial Constraints: Limited money for projects, economic problems.
          Leverage Points: Investing in renewable energy to reduce fossil fuel use.
        </p>

        <p>
          What makes this system very clear and direct, and why I used it as an example, is because its clear to
          follow how energy supply directly affects economic growth and quality of life. Access to energy can change
          communities; allowing businesses to work, students to study, and hospitals to operate effectively. The use
          of renewable energy can also reduce environmental damage, making the system more sustainable in the long
          run.
        </p>

        <p>
          So as a conclusion:
          The energy supply system to poor countries is:
          Hierarchical
          Has Stocks and Flows
          Affected by Constraints and Needs Resilience
          Understanding these dynamics helps improve energy access, support sustainable growth, and better life in
          poor regions.
        </p>

        <p>
          When it came to diagrams, I decided not to go with this system. I want to have more fun with this class, so
          instead of going with something clear and reliable, I decided to go with something a little harder to pin
          down - time perception. I understand that this will come with much more critique, but I am welcome to it.
        </p>

        <h3 style="font-size: 1.5em;">PERCEPTION OF TIME IN NY</h3>

        <p>
          The perception of time is the system chosen because of its fluidity
          between abstract and concrete, the way it exists in many more obviously tangible systems, and the effect it
          has on individual and societal behaviors. It is broad enough to vary depending on culture, but specific
          enough to be analysed through doors, paths, and apps. The perception of time can be conceptualized as a
          system because it
          has many interacting components, even though it seems the components
          are fluid depending on what factors are chosen to analyze.
          These interacting components are tied together by an application. They include environmental phenomena,
          biological processes, cognitive factors, and how it all appears in our tech.

          And the system holds its importance in the way it affects how we live our lives, it influences
          our decisions, our relationships, our work, and our mental health. Understanding this invisible 
          influence will improve the way we design products, buildings, and our cities to improve wellbeing 
          and productivity.
        </p>

        <p>
          Inputs can be factors that influence the perception of time, especially controlled 
factors, such as how much daylight is accessible, the flow of people in space, sounds, temperature, etc. 
The outputs are cognitive responses, energy levels, human interactions, speeding up, slowing down, etc. 
And the resources are the hardest part to define, but in this case, they could be anything between attention, 
memory, money, consumption, time spent in a place, etc.

        <h2>Rube Goldberg Machine</h2>
        <p>
          This is how we planned our Rube Goldberg sequence. First, our Rube Goldberg machine 
          was triggered from the previous group's dancing Trump video.
        </p>
        <li>
          <strong>Dance Movement Detection:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>We used a webcam that captured the movements of the dancer, prompting
              him to dance. And then once the program recognizes that the subject 
              is dancing, will trigger the IFTTT device. .</li>
    
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hairdryer Activation:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>When dance movements are detected, the computer sends a signal to an IFTTT plug.</li>
            <li>IFTTT triggers the hairdryer to blow air onto the makeshift carousel.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Spinning Carousel and Water bucket:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>The carousel rotates as soon as the hairdryer air hits it,
              and will spin a few times gatehring momentum. There is a string tied
              to it, which will eventually yank on the next object, a cup filled with water.
              </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Arduino Liquid Sensor:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>The water spills into a container, and activates the Arduino liquid sensor.</li>
            <li>The Arduino sends a signal to the second computer.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hand-Holding Sensor:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>The second computer prompts people to hold two ends of Arduino jumper wires by
              asking them to hold hands and make a circle.
            </li>
            <li>When the circuit is completed, the second sequence is triggered.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Celebratory Screen and Clap Sensor:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>The celebratory screen displays a celebratory and invites the audience to clap.</li>
            <li>The sound sensor detects the clap, triggering the next group’s machine.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

          <p>
            This all seems like a very futile attempt to gain control over something that has already lost control a very long time ago. We’re all going to use AI, so we’re already working off a platform that is so skewed, and so many subjective ideas that we could easily challenge and tip over, will be the lattice on which we stand, if we want to keep up with the pace of the progress of tech. I think that on the smaller scale, we can try to create tools that go against certain principles, that challenge ideals, that refuse to perpetuate without questioning, but I think these tools will only be used on a very small scale - and only for our own creative exploration, because the world is already so steeped in the biases and political agendas of long-gone ancestors. If we were to start over, it would take our entire lifetimes to create a tool from scratch, and even then, you could point out a million unavoidable biases.
          </p>
          <p>
            So to give in to this system is really the only way for actual economic success today.
          </p>
          <p>
            And although I don’t think it is impossible to create more thoughtful, ethical tools, I do believe that to give in to the system first, to understand it, to play by its rules, is the only way you can Trojan horse your way into any real change. So if you’re at that point, you’d already be steeped in biases that are impossible to scrub off.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m a deeply cultural person, I’m very in tune with my heritage, language, and I appreciate culture more than the people around me back home, I teach Bedouin poetry, and I would say that I put a lot of effort into trying to learn and embody my roots. However, at the same time, I speak English, I know and can adapt into Western culture, I am known back home as the Americanized Kuwaiti. I’m a walking contradiction. So I guess I am Trojan horsing my way into this territory, with attempts to understand the system from their own viewpoint, and to slowly dismantle it for myself.
          </p>
          <p>
            As for the development of AI, I do agree and am fascinated with the speed of it, and I do believe that we are all sprinting to keep up - and we’re going too fast to really think of where we’re stepping. We are all Alice, following the white rabbit urgently to somewhere unknown, without having the time to ask WHERE ARE YOU TAKING US?
          </p>
          <p>
            However, I do disagree with the articles talking about the dangers of AI because these dangers are not due to AI. Every issue discussed, whether it's from the first book that looks at digital evolution as a house of cards or the last article which sees AI as grouping the world into stereotypes, is already so present in the world that we live in. They are so big, confirmation bias, solidification of refutable concepts, in math, in politics, in religion, in language, in documentation, in your everyday life, that they are difficult to see. It’s too big and encompassing that we’re not able to see it clearly. This new tool only puts a magnifying glass on something that has already been controlling us since the dawn of time. Whether it's orientalism, bias for political agendas, Western philosophy being called fact, etc., it was not created with AI, and it certainly cannot be changed within AI. It’s much deeper and bigger than that, and this monster of historical confirmation bias is only rearing its ugly head in a new light.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is how I feel AI works today:
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img src="RR02img3.png" alt=“Sketch 1”>
          </figure>
          <p>
            Back to the actual response - I will answer in a more personal way. So because of who I am, my background, my beliefs, my philosophy is to create tools that actually have very little user input. This is not applicable to widely used tools, but instead embodies my own agenda in learning and creating digital tools. In the simplest terms, the world is already messy, I don’t want that mess seeping into what I create. This might be a pessimistic take, but flexibility doesn’t exist on the large scale, big money, big influence world. So authorship, although it would be great if people used tools that had a wide enough authorship quota that anyone can contribute and be heard by everyone else, that contradicts big money and influence. The tools I create are transparent, clear, show my bias, my background, and allow users to interact in a limited way. And if I wanted to create something that was truly neutral, that means I’m unknowingly creating a platform for the world to exercise its bias once again. It’s me or them, so it will be me. If I could create a language model, it would be clearly specific to my worldview, without pretending it is unbiased. People know what they’re getting into. Tools WILL ALWAYS BE BIASED!
          </p>
          <p>
            So the user can control inputs, applications, and the program should be malleable enough that users can apply it to different parts of their life.
          </p>
          <p>
            The program author, myself, is from a clear background, with clear incentives, with clear data that I am pulling from. I will not claim to be unbiased or to hold a worldview wider than my own eyes and personal experience. I will have the most control over the output, and whoever approaches my program will know what they’re getting into. Again. I believe this is how tools are anyways, I’m just being transparent about it.
          </p>
          <p>
            The masses author is the trickiest part. This will require a lot of research but I believe the data I pull from will have to be vetted, translated, and organized. Data will only be a product of the people it is representing, and I will avoid, or try to avoid, sources documenting people or histories or sciences that are not their own histories. Microphones will not be passed around.
          </p>
          <p>
            How I think AI is now, and how I feel it should be.
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img src="RR02img1.png" alt=“Sketch 2”>
          </figure>
     <figure>
            <img src="RR02img2.png" alt=“Sketch 3”>
          </figure>
          <p>
            So in this sense, I do prefer sources like Twitter, where each person speaks for themselves, and as a user you can clearly see where the data is coming from. Youtube, which also has a clear platform, and a clear message, and you can choose who are you are listening to. I enjoy reddit for the same reasons as well. which have more clear information than AI models, however I do think some sort of AI could be built on a different skeleton where you choose which sources are being analysed. Behance, Pinterest, and Are.na allow users to curate their interface a bit more than the previous social media websites, and they allow you to delve deeper into your niche. They have more of the user’s voice.

      <details class="collapsible">
        <summary> Authorship philosophy - Perception of Time in Cities</summary>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            So ultimately, the level of authorship users should have on online tools, if I’m speaking from the voice of the developer, should be minimal enough that every input is constrained, feeding into the digital tool. The output of said digital tool will reflect only some of the user input, but will mostly reflect the developer himself. The reason for this is because it makes bias, lock-in syndrome, and other implicit influences on the outputs of our tech more explicit. It points the finger to what you should be analyzing, rather than falling into the trap of assuming that the output of a digital product is mostly influenced by the user’s input, when in actuality, what the output reflects is already heavily embedded in the tool itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            The system I chose previously was the perception of time and understanding its effect on people. It looks at the stakeholders of who is controlling that perception, and some specific applications in certain urban settings.
          </p>
          <p>
            The authorship one has on their perception of time illustrates my authorship philosophy perfectly. The individual might assume they are fully “in charge” of their own “time”. Their productivity, movement in a city, and understanding of time passing seems to be in their hands. Once time is wasted or used ineffectively, the user will look at their own hands instead of looking at the world built around them.
          </p>
          <p>
            The biggest “lock-in” idea is the concept of time itself. once developed from sun-time, to water-time, to gravity-time, to spring-time, to now, quantum-time, is an untouchable, unmoving force that we live within. The way it presents itself in digital tools is the fact that time will always go back to Greenwich time, which is neither necessary nor accurate. In the tools I create, users will be more aware of what their perception of time stems from, but for this to be possible, their input is minimal.
          </p>
          <p>
            The copyright of the tool or AI is essential because it demands accountability. If people use ChatGPT as a search engine, then they will only have access to the world through the LLM’s lenses. Nothing the AI produces should be taken as an accurate representation of what exists in the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Flexibility should include inputs, interfaces, languages, topics, strengths, and weaknesses, but not the content of the output.
          </p>
          <p>
            I should have the most control in my practice, and I should be clearly given credit for that, because whatever biases I am harboring, I should be held accountable for.
          </p>
          <p>
            Authors and artists should be credited, and the AI should also be credited for transparency and accountability. User input should be given out responsibility, with the understanding that more input leads to more general results.
          </p>
          <p>
            To apply this to broader tech, in general, it seems if the input by the user is less, the output will be dependent on the lock-in ideas that exist, so on the opinion of the internet. It will be more focused and more steeped in bias and stereotype. Some are explicit stereotypes, but the overwhelming majority are the implicit ones - bias towards a certain type of logic, or representation, or language, that we mistakenly accept as fact. The more input the user has, the technology is forced to generalize, so the bias is less influential.
          </p>

      <h2>Generative Zine</h2>
      <p>
        We "authored" a tool to illustrate how less user input leads to a more focused output,
        often reflecting the voice/bias of the tool. The more user input, the more general the 
        result is, and the less the voice of the tool is apparent.

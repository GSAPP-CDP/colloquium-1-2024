        <h2>What is the system?</h2>
        <p>
          I’m interested in one-to-one synchronous connections facilitated by action-based embodied computation systems
          — i.e. mobile computing devices. The ecosystem of mobile communication technologies we use in the present day
          displace and prioritize our attention in the asynchronous and placeless landscape of digital space, through a
          number of affordances and rulesets that create negative reinforcement loops to keep our attention and
          cognition within the same digital space. The purpose of our talk and communication in life is to connect two
          known or unknown persons together through the ignition of action into a social situation that then turns into
          an encounter. If the core function of mobile technology is to communicate with other people, the current
          affordances and rulesets within our devices have lost sight of this vision through the introduction of a
          number of unfocused (yet helpful) affordances and ruleset that create many superfluous pathways for our
          communication to fail and get lost in the act of passive and heavy strategy-focused engagements.

        <h2>On Authorship</h2>
        <p>
          I am interested in authoring systems that re-center a user’s sociality in the physical world through
          action-based hardware. The screen-based “remote-for-everything” affordance and configuration of mobile
          computing and communication has forgone the core purpose of connecting with information and people for
          affording us the ability to observe our interests from whatever corner of the algorithm our usage has
          delivered us to. If we think of the mobile computation devices on our possession as a compass that focuses and
          points our attention to whatever idea and person we aim it at in digital space, we must prioritize the system
          and conditions that human communication thrives in: Social situations that can lead to encounters where talk
          happens. A social situation as defined by Erving Goffman essentially is an environment of mutual monitoring
          potential that can become active the second that two or more people have the possibility of interacting. An
          Encounter ensues the moment two or more people engage with each other. The wayfinding of computation we
          possess on our persons should prioritize this order of social interaction in localities by not
          disproportionately dispossessing this ability into a placeless digital space (or application) that is defined
          by the employment of strategy (asynchronous talk) to facilitate connection to places and ideas. Technology
          must allow for the ability to be interrupted in the here and now and participate in locality over navigating
          life where an algorithm wishes to displace you.
        <p>
          Hardware and software systems like the <b> Apple Watch </b> in conjunction with it’s additional sensors which
          afford
          vital tracking of the user empower users and other interoperable software systems and spaces like
          <b>Strava</b> and
          MyFitnessPal to drive platform-specific community engagement and storytelling solely through active usage of
          their additional sensors to generate “content” and data for sharing with your community.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, the reduction of interaction affordances in conjunction with the reading of motor sensors in
          vehicles with <b>CarPlay</b> afford the focused activity of “connected driving” experiences. Motion sensors in
          external and interoperable accessories (in this case a vehicle) focus the usage of the computation systems /
          cognitions we carry on our persons everyday to afford the focused and safe operation of a vehicle from point A
          to point B.

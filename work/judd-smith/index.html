        <h2>What is the system?</h2>
        <p>
          I’m interested in one-to-one synchronous connections facilitated by action-based embodied computation systems
          — i.e. mobile computing devices. The ecosystem of mobile communication technologies we use in the present day
          displace and prioritize our attention in the asynchronous and placeless landscape of digital space, through a
          number of affordances and rulesets that create negative reinforcement loops to keep our attention and
          cognition within the same digital space. The purpose of our talk and communication in life is to connect two
          known or unknown persons together through the ignition of action into a social situation that then turns into
          an encounter. If the core function of mobile technology is to communicate with other people, the current
          affordances and rulesets within our devices have lost sight of this vision through the introduction of a
          number of unfocused (yet helpful) affordances and ruleset that create many superfluous pathways for our
          communication to fail and get lost in the act of passive and heavy strategy-focused engagements.

        <h2>On Authorship</h2>
        <p>
          I am interested in authoring systems that re-center a user’s sociality in the physical world through
          action-based hardware. The screen-based “remote-for-everything” affordance and configuration of mobile
          computing and communication has forgone the core purpose of connecting with information and people for
          affording us the ability to observe our interests from whatever corner of the algorithm our usage has
          delivered us to. If we think of the mobile computation devices on our possession as a compass that focuses and
          points our attention to whatever idea and person we aim it at in digital space, we must prioritize the system
          and conditions that human communication thrives in: Social situations that can lead to encounters where talk
          happens. A social situation as defined by Erving Goffman essentially is an environment of mutual monitoring
          potential that can become active the second that two or more people have the possibility of interacting. An
          Encounter ensues the moment two or more people engage with each other. The wayfinding of computation we
          possess on our persons should prioritize this order of social interaction in localities by not
          disproportionately dispossessing this ability into a placeless digital space (or application) that is defined
          by the employment of strategy (asynchronous talk) to facilitate connection to places and ideas. Technology
          must allow for the ability to be interrupted in the here and now and participate in locality over navigating
          life where an algorithm wishes to displace you.
        <p>
          Hardware and software systems like the <b> Apple Watch </b> in conjunction with it’s additional sensors which
          afford
          vital tracking of the user empower users and other interoperable software systems and spaces like
          <b>Strava</b> and
          MyFitnessPal to drive platform-specific community engagement and storytelling solely through active usage of
          their additional sensors to generate “content” and data for sharing with your community.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, the reduction of interaction affordances in conjunction with the reading of motor sensors in
          vehicles with <b>CarPlay</b> afford the focused activity of “connected driving” experiences. Motion sensors in
          external and interoperable accessories (in this case a vehicle) focus the usage of the computation systems /
          cognitions we carry on our persons everyday to afford the focused and safe operation of a vehicle from point A
          to point B.

      <p>
        I am interested in locality, human connection, people’s movement and motivating factors to navigate and where
        they go, as a general principle I am interested in highly personal datasets that afford the ability to express
        the texture of our human sentience in a way that contrasts what is commonly computed at scale with traditional
        datasets. While both macro and micro datasets within the purview of my work, I believe macro datasets should be
        only 20% of the story, painting a continuum of regional to global trends around movement, usage of tools, and
        demographic data to successfully identify who, when and where, but the 80% of data captured should be micro,
        zooming into high-resolution of the stories of a few based in specific regions to uncover the individual and not
        just number and index and individuals presence. Through making visible indexes of minute stories / intimate
        details around an individual's movement and texture of community, these datasets will inherently afford a deeper
        sense of empathy towards individuals within a network. This type of data can only come about from peer to peer
        interaction and local data collection — not just from macro-datasets devoid of interacting with those indexed
        and affected by them.

        <p>
          What would a world of technology intuitively connecting individuals and information simply as nodes of
          information to let serendipity and the generation / improvisational navigation of talk? Our devices and the
          current formulation of mobile computing has overreached to the stage of letting the “computer” complete the
          loop and answer the question. Imagine walking into a room where those around you are not engrossed in their
          own pool of information served to them from by a software system, but instead are engaged and aware of their
          surroundings in an embodied way that allows for the natural serendipitous dialogue between those in different
          spaces of the world, and are encouraged to engage with others. Instead of running to social media or
          exchanging and filtering the different aspects of ourselves across personal, professional, and formal means,
          what if our devices intuitively sent out pings to those around us to foster a deeper sense of connection in
          our local community? What if the technology and pipelines of communication that remain on our persons had a
          minimal amount of ways just delivered you your networks “talk” and contextual information to keep you present
          in your environment without affording too many ways of interacting with information via a screen that takes
          you out of your here-and-now? What if the dialogue between our information and network happening in our
          devices was not just trapped in a loop between you and your screen, but your device spoke to those around you
          as well through non-verbal signaling communication? I always think of Sasori from Naruto — a villain who
          turned his own body into a puppet by storing the core of his heart and energy into a central chamber that made
          him modular in being able to inhabit many different bodies at once that all afforded different types of
          actions. What if our technology, like sasori, was the computational heart that resuscitate shells of different
          forms of technological affordances to best fit our intended action for them. At the core of all of this
          postulation — what happens if our world looked up and kept our ears open hungry for our next interaction and
          bump of information from our locality again, in community, vs. a digital spaces that cuts off the ability to
          convert a social situation into an encounter?

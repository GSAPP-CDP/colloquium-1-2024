        <h3>Utilization system of PUBLIC SPACES</h3>
        <img src="pic1.jpg"><img src="pic2.jpg"><img src="pic3.jpg"><img src="pic4.jpg"><img src="pic5.jpg">
        <h4>The utilization system of public spaces, particularly parks, exhibits fascinating and complex dynamics. This system consists of elements such as people, the physical structure of the park (e.g., benches, trees, lawns), and various activities (e.g., walking, exercising, picnicking). The purpose of this system is to provide people with opportunities for relaxation, leisure, and social interaction.
 
          One of the most interesting dynamics within this system is the presence of feedback loops. For example, the cleanliness of the park can influence how frequently people visit it. If the park is clean and well-maintained, more people are likely to visit, providing positive feedback for its upkeep. Conversely, if the park is dirty, the number of visitors may decrease, creating a negative feedback loop that further deteriorates the park's condition.
           
          The leverage points in this system are critical for significantly improving its efficiency. For instance, optimizing the placement of trash bins within the park or implementing regular cleaning programs with volunteers can serve as leverage points, enhancing the overall user experience.
           
          The boundaries of this system include not only the physical limits of the park but also constraints such as operating hours. For example, if the park closes at night, alternative spaces or programs might be necessary to accommodate those who wish to use the park during nighttime. Alternatively, closing the park at night could prevent the entry of homeless individuals, thereby improving the park's cleanliness and overall pleasantness.
           
          The function or purpose of this system has a particularly intriguing aspect: during the day, the park is used by people for activities such as exercising, walking, and picnicking, while at night, it may serve as a shelter or home for homeless individuals. This shift in users and purposes according to the time of day highlights the dynamic nature of the park's utilization.
           
          These elements make the Public Space(park) utilization system a complex and adaptive system, continually evolving through interconnected feedback loops and dynamics.

        <h1 id="assignment-2">2 – Authorship</h1>
        <h3>Authorship of Public Space Utilization Systems</h3>
        <h4>In the realm of public space utilization systems, users encompass all individuals. "Lock-in" refers to elements such as the arrangement of structures and restrictions on nighttime use in public spaces, which users cannot alter. However, how spaces are utilized remains a matter of individual choice. For example, people may ride bicycles, enjoy picnics, sleep overnight in these areas and even organize events such as performances or farmer’s markets. 
          In this context, interfaces designed for experts primarily serve these secondary authors. For instance, when reconfiguring public spaces temporarily for events like farmers' markets or performances, organizers need city’s permission. In contrast, non-expert interfaces focus on how general users can effectively utilize established rules. Users can sit on benches, enjoy coffee, walk or jog on park tracks—all determined by user choice.
          In this system, primary authors typically include government bodies or city councils responsible for overall public space management and regulation. They oversee infrastructure placement, enforce usage rules, and ensure public safety. By fulfilling these responsibilities, public spaces operate efficiently, meet diverse user needs, and adapt according to regulations. Users, in turn, are responsible for using public spaces without causing damage and complying with established rules, thereby allowing significant flexibility for various activities.
          Moreover, users can also become secondary authors within this system. For instance, when organizing exercise classes or performances in public spaces, they act as new program authors, establishing rules such as designated areas or admission fees. This iterative process involving secondary authors generates new dynamics, accumulating usage data through apps like Eventbrite for open data. This data can be flexibly utilized for insights into factors such as participant numbers by time slot, with personal information data being inaccessible and protected by stringent lock-in requirements.
          Finally, issues regarding AI and intellectual copyrights may arise when constructing public spaces based on city transit patterns and usage data. However, I believe that AI only assists in the design process, and the copyright for the results belongs to the actual builders, designers, and project participants. This is because AI is sensitive to biases influenced by human inputs and choices, and thus cannot be solely credited for producing the results entirely on its own.

        <h4>When considering authorship models related to public space management, products like Eventbrite, Citymapper, and Meetup provide critical examples of how interactions within urban environments are facilitated and documented.
          Eventbrite stands out in managing events such as farmers' markets or pop-up stores. This platform enables organizers to digitally create, promote, and manage events, clearly assigning copyright to event creators. This empowers organizers to manage event logistics and participant engagement while collecting crucial data on participant demographics and event performance. Eventbrite's copyright model prioritizes the recognition and management of events within public spaces, offering insights into usage patterns and participant behaviors. This model enhances event organization, optimizes space utilization, and promotes community participation to strengthen public space utilization.
          Citymapper contributes to understanding public space utilization by tracking and analyzing urban transit patterns. As users navigate cities using public transportation options, Citymapper records data on travel routes, public transport usage statistics, and congestion points. This data is essential for urban planners to optimize transportation infrastructure and improve mobility within public spaces. Citymapper's emphasis on data collection and analysis aligns with my system by providing insights into how people interact within urban environments, understanding diverse user behaviors and preferences. This enables my system to meet diverse user needs and optimize space utilization.
          Meetup fosters community participation through local events and gatherings. From activities like farmers' market meetings to pop-up store openings, Meetup supports event promotion, RSVP management, and community connections. Meetup's model encourages event organizers to create meaningful experiences tailored to specific interests and demographics. The platform records data on event attendance, member interactions, and community growth, helping organizers understand participant interests and event impact. By promoting community participation and recording interactions within public spaces, Meetup aligns well with the goal of enhancing public space utilization within my system. Leveraging Meetup's features allows my system to encourage community-driven events and enhance participant communication.

         <h4>My authorship philosophy focuses on providing users with opportunities to engage in creative and innovative activities within a framework that respects basic guidelines. The utilization of public spaces is linked to physical and mental health benefits, so users should have the flexibility to engage in activities in various ways. Therefore, my authorship philosophy aims to create a structure where stakeholders like governments, city councils, event organizers (secondary authors), and users (user authors) contribute to and collaboratively make decisions. Thus, empowerment involves focusing on creating tools and systems that enable stakeholders to actively manipulate their realities, fostering a sense of ownership and responsibility.

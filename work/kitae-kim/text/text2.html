            The unique layout means you'll have to deal with an awkward floor plan. 
            Also, it’s not as quiet as advertised—expect noise from the street and neighboring units."</p>
        <p class="highlight red">
            "Convertible just means you might be able to squeeze 
            in a second bed if you're okay with a cramped living area. 
            The so-called luxury amenities are basic at best, and the private 
            outdoor space is a tiny, unkempt balcony."</p>
        <p class="highlight red">
            "Cozy actually means the place is quite small and 
            barely fits the essentials. The doorman and elevator 
            are nice touches, but the quiet area is just a view of a brick wall and an air shaft."</p>

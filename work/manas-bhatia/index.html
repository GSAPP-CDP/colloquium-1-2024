        <h2><strong>What is the system?</strong></h2>
        <p>
          The digital workflows of architects represent a complex system composed of interconnected 
          elements aimed at enhancing design efficiency and producing superior built environments.
          This system integrates human and non-human components, including 
          <span id="animated-list"></span>.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          The elements within this system encompass various design processes and tools that collectively 
          enhance productivity. The function of non-human elements is to streamline design efficiency, 
          while the purpose of the human system, namely the architects, is to create better and more 
          sustainable built spaces.
        </p>

        <p>
          Feedback loops are crucial in this system. A reinforcing feedback loop amplifies productivity: 
          as better tools and technologies lead to greater efficiency, they encourage further adoption 
          of advanced solutions. The improved built environment enhances architects' productivity, creating 
          a balancing feedback loop. Additionally, the better the design software and tools, 
          the higher the productivity, establishing another reinforcing feedback loop.
        </p>

        <p>
          Stocks, in this context, refer to the accumulated resources such as the overall design efficiency 
          and productivity. Inflows include elements like design software, tools, and client-set 
          design briefs. These inputs help architects create and refine their designs. The outflows 
          consist of the drawings and plans that guide the execution of built spaces. As the inflows 
          improve with better tools and clearer briefs, the outflows become more efficient and accurate, 
          leading to higher productivity and better-designed environments.
        </p>

        <h2><strong>Whom does it impact?</strong></h2>
  
        <p>
          The digital workflows of architects impact a diverse range of stakeholders, including 
          clients who drive project requirements and provide feedback, and architects who use 
          these workflows to develop and present designs. Design tool developers influence the 
          efficiency and quality of these processes, while project managers and contractors rely 
          on accurate information for timely and budget-compliant execution. Consultants 
          provide specialized expertise, ensuring structural integrity and regulatory compliance. 
          Government and regulatory bodies enforce adherence to building codes and standards. 
          End-users, who ultimately inhabit the built environment, are affected by the design's 
          quality and functionality. Additionally, the local community experiences broader impacts, 
          such as aesthetic and environmental effects, while investors seek assurances of 
          project feasibility and returns. Understanding these stakeholders' roles and needs is 
          crucial for optimizing digital workflows to ensure efficient, collaborative, 
          and successful project outcomes.

        <h2><strong>What are its leverage points?</strong></h2>
  
        <p>
          Optimizing the integration of generative AI, for instance, can drastically reduce 
          the time required for initial design phases, allowing architects to handle more projects 
          simultaneously. This optimization removes redundancies, accelerating the workflow and 
          boosting productivity.

        <h2><strong>Authorship in Digital Workflows of Architects</strong></h2>
  
        <p>
          In the chosen system of the digital workflows of architects, there are various stakeholders 
          who interact with different levels of expertise.
        </p>


        <h2><strong>Clients:</strong></h2>

        <p>
          Have authorship over project requirements and final approvals. As non-technical stakeholders, 
          they need tools that are intuitive and flexible, allowing them to articulate needs and 
          understand design concepts. For example, while architects can lock-in massing options, clients 
          should control the architectural style and look-and-feel. They should have the ability to 
          provide feedback throughout the design process, ensuring their vision is realized.
        </p>


        <h2><strong>Architects:</strong></h2>

        <p>
          Have authorship over creative designs, needing a balance of lock-in and flexibility. Lock-in 
          ensures consistency and streamlines repetitive tasks, while flexibility allows creative exploration 
          and customization. Design tools should offer standardized workflows for efficiency and interoperability, 
          yet allow customization for unique project requirements. Architects should be credited for their 
          creative input, which combines personal expertise with digital tools. They must ensure their designs 
          are original, comply with regulations, and ethically incorporate AI-generated elements.
        </p>

        <h2><strong>Project Managers & Contractors:</strong></h2>

        <p>
          Require lock-in for compliance and efficient project management but need flexibility for on-site 
          variations and unexpected challenges. They have authorship over project timelines, execution, and 
          handling labor, ensuring the project is built according to drawings and specifications while maintaining 
          flexibility with timelines.
        </p>

        <h2><strong>Consultants (Engineers, etc.):</strong></h2>

        <p>
          Benefit from standardized data formats for seamless integration and file sharing but need flexibility to 
          apply their specialized knowledge. They have authorship over their specific fields, like landscape 
          planning or structural design, which they lock in for the project. However, other project aspects are 
          locked in for them, with limited flexibility. Architects may overrule their decisions, requiring them to 
          adjust proposals to fit the overall project concept.
        </p>

        <h2><strong>Government & Regulatory Bodies:</strong></h2>

        <p>
          Require strict lock-in to ensure adherence to standards and regulations. In that sense they have the 
          greatest authorship over the built spaces but cannot take credit for the creative expression of the project.
        </p>

        <h2><strong>Software Developers:</strong></h2>

        <p>
          Control the technical framework, ensuring it meets industry standards and user needs while being adaptable to 
          new innovations. They must be recognized for encoding rules and functionalities that enable architects to 
          perform their tasks efficiently. Developers create the framework within which users operate and are responsible 
          for making transparent and ethical tools, ensuring users understand the tool's capabilities and limitations. 
          The tool itself should not have copyright over the produced work, which should belong to the architect using 
          the tool. However, developers should receive credit through licensing agreements. For AI tools, credit should 
          be given to the architects whose works were referenced or used to train the AI models.
        </p>

        <p>
          Incorporating these tools into my practice will streamline the design process, reduce redundancies, and enhance client 
          satisfaction. Leveraging each tool's strengths will maintain high creativity and flexibility while ensuring efficient 
          project delivery and client engagement.
        </p>

        <h2><strong>Generative Zine</strong></h2>

        <p>
          The Zine has been designed a utilitarian tool that provides information to the users about the boroughs they choose (lock-in)
          and lets them rate the area from 1-star to 5-star (user authorship)...
        </p>

        <h2><strong>Buildings closer to Hudson river have higher rentals as compared to other areas
        </strong></h2>

        <h2><strong>Data manifesto:</strong></h2>

        <p>
          The collected data illuminates the variations in rental prices, specifically how they fluctuate based on the buildings' proximity 
          to the Hudson River. Higher rents correlate with taller buildings, with those offering river views commanding significantly higher prices, 
          likely due to their enhanced views and the premium charged for such vistas. Market trends indicate that neighborhoods closer to 
          the river have experienced increases in their median asking rents, whereas areas further from the river have either seen no change or a 
          decrease in rental prices. However, the data does not establish a direct relationship between river proximity and rent, as rental 
          prices in Manhattan are also influenced by the neighborhoods in which the buildings are located. For instance, buildings in neighborhoods 
          farther from the river can exhibit similar rent prices. Notably, rent prices south of Central Park are substantially higher than those 
          in the north, independent of river proximity.
        </p>

        <p>
          The data collection process was straightforward, utilizing property rental websites such as Streeteasy and Zillow. However, obtaining building 
          heights by neighborhood through NYC Open Data “Property Valuation and Assessment Data” was challenging, as the data is organized by boroughs 
          rather than neighborhoods. Additional efforts are needed to locate data for properties with scenic views, like river views, as these often 
          command a premium due to the aesthetic and perceived quality of life benefits they offer.
        </p>

        <p>
          The data were sourced from rental property aggregator platforms designed to help users find the best properties. These platforms do not 
          filter searches by distance from the river. Rental prices vary significantly based on amenities, interior design, and furnishing levels. 
          Distances were measured using Google Earth, and the properties selected for rental price analysis were mapped using the Streeteasy website, 
          adopting a top-down approach.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          For a more comprehensive understanding, it would be beneficial to utilize data from NYC Open Data. Additionally, the sample size currently 
          selected is small and may not provide a clear picture. Conducting surveys could also offer valuable first-person insights into the problem 
          or hypothesis. It is noteworthy that rental prices in Manhattan exhibit significant extremes, ranging from as low as $1,500 per month 
          to $100,000 per month. Moreover, it is interesting to observe market trends and how rental costs have increased, decreased, or remained stable 
          in different parts of the city.
        </p>

        <p>
          To further analyse this, we may need to get more data on aspects like the amenities that different neighbourhoods have like the subways, 
          the median income of the people living there,  Population Density, Crime Rate, Proximity to Schools and Parks, etc as an antithesis since some 
          areas even though they are near the river may have low median income and as a result the rental costs may be affected
        </p>

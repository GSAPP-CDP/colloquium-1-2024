        <h2>What is the system?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            A system that I am particularly drawn to is the parasitic system, such as mycelium.
            Mycelium, the vegetative part of fungi, consists of a network of fine white filaments
            (hyphae) that infiltrate and colonize host organisms. This system exemplifies
            fascinating dynamics and interactions within ecosystems, particularly through its
            parasitic relationships.
            </p>
            <section>
              
              <h2>Whom does it impact?</h2>
              <br>
              <p> 
            In this system, the elements include the mycelium, the host organism (such as plants
            or trees), and the surrounding environment. The function of the parasitic mycelium
            is to extract nutrients from the host, often at the host's expense, to sustain its
            own growth and reproduction. The feedback loop in this system is intricate; as the
            mycelium extracts nutrients, it weakens the host, potentially leading to a reinforcing
            feedback loop where the declining health of the host further facilitates the spread
            of the mycelium. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            Conversely, a balancing feedback loop may occur if the host develops defenses that
            limit the spread of the parasite, maintaining a dynamic equilibrium. Stocks in this
            system include the nutrients within the host and the biomass of the mycelium. Flows
            represent the transfer of these nutrients from the host to the mycelium. The frequency
            and delay of these flows depend on environmental conditions, such as moisture and
            temperature, which can accelerate or slow down the mycelium's growth. Leverage points
            in the parasitic mycelium system could involve altering environmental conditions to
            disrupt the parasitic relationship, such as changing soil composition or introducing
            competing organisms. The system's hierarchy is evident in the mycelium's position
            within the ecosystem, often acting as a decomposer but shifting roles when engaging
            in parasitism.
        </p>
        <section>
          <h2>What are its leverage points?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            Boundaries of this system are defined by the extent of the mycelium's reach and the
            host organism's range. The resilience of this system is notable; mycelium can persist
            in adverse conditions and quickly exploit opportunities for growth. This resilience
            allows the system to withstand disturbances, such as changes in environmental conditions
            or the introduction of new host defenses, and maintain its essential functions and
            structure. The most interesting dynamic of this system is the mycelium's ability to adapt
            and exploit its host, showcasing nature's intricate balance between cooperation and
            competition. However, this adaptability can also be problematic, as it can lead to the
            decline or death of host organisms, potentially disrupting entire ecosystems. 
            Understanding and managing this system is crucial for maintaining ecological balance
            and health.

        <h2>Recording and Collecting Recycling Behaviors in Apartment Buildings using Participatory Gadget (APP)</h2>
        
            <h2>Useful Lock-In in My System</h2>
          <p>
The ultimate author of my system is the City or the Municipality that controls the recycling efforts. Co-authors that also control my system are individual entities participating in recycling efforts laid out by the city. Within each apartment building, there are people who collect the recycling and place it outdoors for pickup. These entities responsible for sorting through the recycling are also co-authors. In my system, everyone, even those who do not participate in the recycling process, are authors. Everyone who lives in the apartment units is a participant in recycling, whether actively or passively.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Lock-in measures</h2>
<p>Data Privacy_Ensuring that the data collected by the app does not tap into individuals' identification, addresses, or phone numbers. This is crucial to protect personal information and maintain trust.
Compliance and Standards_Adhering to municipal guidelines and standards to ensure the system’s integrity and reliability. 
</p>
<br>
<h2>Flexibility in My System</h2>
<p>Flexibility is better used in
Data Availability_Making the number of participants in each apartment building available as open-source data. This allows any audience to use the data for research or development purposes, fostering innovation and wider use.
User Engagement_Providing a flexible system that can adapt to the various needs and preferences of users, encouraging broader participation and interaction.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Variability in User Interface Design</h2>
<p>If there were an app that collects and tracks recycling behaviors of participants in apartment buildings, it could:</p>
<h3>For Active Participants</h3>
<p>Lock-In_securely record participation without compromising personal data. This would enhance user trust and compliance.
Impact_Provides a clear and reliable map or graph of recycling participation, helping the city track and improve recycling efforts.</p> 
<h3>For Passive Participants</h3>
<p>Flexibility_Simplified interface that allows easy reporting of recycling activities, perhaps with incentives for participation.
  Impact_Encourages more residents to become active participants, thereby increasing overall recycling rates.</p>

<br>
<h2>Authorship Models and Credit</h2>

<p>User Author_Residents and building staff who contribute data through the app should be credited for their participation. An incentive system, such as discounts on public transportation, could further motivate involvement.
Program Author_As the developer, my role is to ensure the system is ethical, secure, and transparent.
Masses Author_The city and its broader community, who provide the initial data and context, should be acknowledged for their foundational role.</p>
<br>
<h2>Copyright Considerations</h2>
<p>AI and Copyright_I believe enforcing copyright laws for AI might hinder the development of new tools. Instead, a reasonable tax or profit-sharing model, such as a percentage of profits going back to the municipality, could support public resources without stifling innovation.
  User-Generated Content_Users should retain rights to their contributions, promoting ownership and responsibility.
  Source Authors_Authors of original datasets should be acknowledged and compensated, ensuring fair use and ethical practices.</p>
<br>
<h2>Responsibility and Accountability</h2>
<p>Being an author, whether a user, developer, or data contributor, carries significant responsibility. Accountability should be maintained through:
  Transparency_Clear communication of data usage and decision-making processes.
  Ethical Guidelines_Establishing and adhering to standards that prevent misuse and harm.
  Legal Frameworks_Ensuring compliance with relevant laws and regulations.</p>
<br>
<h2>Control and Power Distribution</h2>
<h3>Stakeholders with Control </h3>
<p>City/Municipality_Should have control over the system’s overall direction and data security.
  Users_Should have control over their personal data and participation records.
  Developers_Need to maintain system integrity and ensure ethical standards are met.</p>
<br>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>User Empowerment_Through privacy settings, customizable interfaces, and clear ownership policies.
  Developer Oversight_Via rigorous testing, ethical guidelines, and continuous monitoring.
  Author Compensation_By implementing frameworks for licensing and royalties.</p>
<br>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Balancing “lock-in” and flexibility in technology design is essential to cater to the varied needs 
  of stakeholders in the recycling system. Thoughtful approaches to authorship, responsibility, and 
  control can create an ethical, efficient, and user-friendly environment that encourages participation 
  and innovation in recycling efforts.

      <h4>Generative Zine demonstrating the concept of "co-creation"</h4>
  </figure>
  <br>
  <h3>Authorship Philosophy</h3>
    <p>Rooted in the notion of collective exchange of information, this bespoke game of participation simulates
      synergy created from collaboration. When the participant accepts further "meetings" of another players, 
      he/she will be able to acquire more data from the pool. If the player does not wish to meet other players, 
      he/she will have ended the game without much additional data being collected.  Each player leaves a trace 
      of the game, where a small thread of data will be attached with his/her character. From this generation of 
      thread, the data pool will select a thread matching and an outcome of a combination of data will be given in a short 
      narrative. The takeawy from this game is the philosophy that the synergy created from the collective data pool
      is more powerful than a single participant experience.

      <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
      <p>We live in the world of this trend where we are aware of population density and depletion of resources.  
        My hypothesis seeks to question what are some things that are already viable to live off of?  
        What are some ways that we do not further deplete the resources by cultivating these edible resources? 
        What grows naturally, and what are these things that we can also consume?  
        For example, do mushrooms grow well outdoors without human influence?</p>

  <p>9. The article A new generation of community gardeners have big goals for cultivating the concrete jungle 
    discusses the challenges and strategies for cultivating vegetables and plants in New York City. It highlights 
    the need for innovative solutions to overcome issues like limited space and the high cost of land. Proposals 
    include tax reductions for properties hosting urban agriculture projects, mandatory solar or green roofs that 
    can double as food-producing areas, and improving water access for community gardens. The importance of 
    designing urban spaces that incorporate food production is also emphasized. </p>

<h2>Data Manifesto</h2>
<p>In my future practice, the types of data and collection methods that resonate most involve ecological, spatial, 
  and observational data. Each dataset offers unique affordances.</p>
<h3>Ecological Data</h3>
<p> Ecological data illuminates species interactions and environmental conditions, supporting my hypothesis 
  about mycelium systems. Finding relevant ecological data was challenging but essential for validating my arguments.
</p> 
<h3>Spatial Data</h3>
<p>Spatial data, collected via GeoJSON and mapping tools, captures precise locations and distributions of mushrooms 
  and plants. It paints a clear picture of spatial relationships but often lacks detailed contextual data. This 
  data can have politics, influenced by the collectors' objectives, potentially impacting accuracy.</p>
<h3>Observational Data</h3>
<p>Observational data from field studies provides a first-person narrative view, offering granular insights but may 
  be biased by the observer's perspective.
  These datasets together illustrate complex ecological systems but leave out nuanced behavioral patterns. Concerns 
  about gaps in data can be addressed by creating custom datasets through user interviews, surveys, and deploying 
  sensors to capture real-time data, ensuring a comprehensive understanding.

<h2>Method Manifesto</h2>

<p>In exploring parasitic mycelium systems and ecological interactions in Central Park, I embrace a methodical approach 
  intertwining exploration, analysis, and visualization. This manifesto outlines the principles and tools guiding my 
  practice.</p>
<br>
<h3>Exploratory and Analytical Synergy</h3>
<p>Balancing curiosity with analytical rigor, my practice delves into the unknown while grounding findings in robust
  analysis, ensuring innovative and credible insights.
</p>
<h3>Design Computation: Grasshopper</h3>
<p>Grasshopper is essential for design computation, enabling meticulous exploration through trial and error. This 
  iterative process refines visualizations and proofs of concept, embodying my hypotheses with precision.
</p>
<h3>Spatial Data Visualization: GeoJSON</h3>
<p>Geojson.io offers a quick means to map spatial data, capturing ecological interactions. Though limited in 
  retaining coordinate-specific data, it initiates the mapping process effectively.
</p>
<h3>Innovative Mapping: AI and Photoshop</h3>
<p>Interactive generative mapping AI with Photoshop provides a dynamic platform for creating compelling representations. 
  These tools are crucial for recording mushroom sightings and conducting shadow studies for mycelium incubators.
</p>
<h3>Adaptive Approach</h3>
<p>My method adapts to new tools, leveraging each for comprehensive, accurate, and engaging visualizations, driving 
  continuous improvement and deeper understanding.

          <div class="half">
            <p>
              When contemplating the waste removal system, we observe significant lock-in. Curbs are “set in stone”, zoning laws are hard to change, and the department of sanitation has protocols and procedures to match. Just like with Lanier’s MIDI example, this is a system that works but is limited in its ability to evolve. The solution is innovation in governance. DAOs might be an interesting option, but a politico-cultural reform in our institutions might be more appropriate.
            </p>
            <p>
              I believe an authorship system should adhere to the following crucial tenets:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>There is a direct business model that provides proportional attribution to creators</li>
              <li>The tools and platforms used in the system enshrine diverse perspectives</li>
              <li>Tools need to be customizable but have a strongly designed default configuration</li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>
            <p>
              When third parties fuel a platform, incentives are misaligned. When consumers pay for content, and creators get paid for it, externalities are minimized. The challenge, of course, is competing with ubiquitous free content. Here I think blockchains might help provide attribution and compensation matching the complex networks of creation that we see.
            </p>
            <p>
              Of course, AI datasets need to be trained with more balanced data or weighted appropriately since we can't really change the biases that already exist in the world and that will surface through labelers and the availability of certain types of content. However, I think we need to go deeper and actually have tools be written by a diverse team of people. Most software commonly used is created by a small and homogeneous group in Silicon Valley. It is also inevitable that systems will have biases and limitations. One thing that sets humans apart from AI is that our “training data sets” are infinitely more nuanced.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even great diversity in the creator team cannot foresee all use cases, and that is why tools should have customizability. They should be usable out of the box and have strong design principles ingrained, unlike Emacs, which can take forever to configure satisfactorily. Simply allowing the user to customize everything is a lack of design initiative. However, if the user has a specific need and needs to alter a particular behavior, they should be able to.
            </p>

              Examples:
            </h4>
            <ol>
              <li>Patreon, Medium
                <ul>
                  <li>These platforms allow consumers to pay creators directly and simply take a cut for running the environment.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>Plantoids
                <ul>
                  <li>This project is fascinating because it invokes evolutionary dynamics, as well as fair attribution in a series of artworks. A sculpture is created, and is given a QR code, where viewers can donate cryptocurrency such that it can "reproduce". Once the fundraising goal is met, the donors vote for which artist will produce the next iteration. This artist needs to take aspects from the ancestor artwork, such that genealogical traits are passed based on what people vote for. Ancestor artists are also rewarded with a percentage of the proceeds, creating a system for continued support.</li>

                </ul>
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>Myspace, Scuttlebutt
                <ul>
                  <li>These tools allow people to express themselves authentically. Myspace allowed HTML customization of your page and encouraged people to represent their personality. Scuttlebutt mimics real-life gossip information spread, which allows for a more natural distribution of knowledge, rather than the curation and pigeonholing that social media algorithms create.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>VSCode, Emacs, XCode
                <ul>
                  <li>In the world of text editors, there are extremely different approaches. I think VSCode is great because it is open source and fully customizable, but when you download it, you can start using it and it is intuitive. Emacs is infinitely customizable but it can take a really long time to get it to a usable state, and when it breaks, you can waste hours just fixing basic functionality. XCode, on the other hand, locks you into a very dogmatic approach and doesn’t allow for almost any customizability. However, it functions quite smoothly. I think a balance is ideal here, and therefore, VSCode wins.</li>

            <h2>A Data Manifesto</h2>
            <p>
              Collecting data can be an immensely tedious task. Whenever possible, I believe it is essential to leverage automated, continuous collection. The data I’m using have been collected for years in the background without effort from my part. Of course, they afford a utilitarian view of myself as a commodity to be advertised to, but this doesn’t prevent the reclaiming of it for the gleaning of alternative insights.
            </p>
            <p>
              When the hypothesis in question is too broad and complex, I believe taking an individual case perspective can help illuminate the key levers of the system. In this case, the environmental cost of online shopping vs. brick-and-mortar is impossible to calculate. The nature of this problem is collective at heart, and one person won’t influence the whole. However, we make decisions on a daily basis, that in aggregate do matter. How else can we guide our choices other than by analyzing our particular situation with the data at hand?

            <p></p>
            <p>
              I started out with my Google Location History, which was a large JSON file with 2 kinds of data points, visits or trips. I focused first on the visits, which just showed coordinates and obscure ID. I had to use the Places API to fetch data about these places so that I could make any sense of them. I then flattened the JSON results and merged them to the dataframe. I filtered for places in NYC and over the past 3 years. This was an exploratory search into the data. I had no particular agenda, but found it fascinating to learn I've been to my friend's house 50 times, or that Joe's Pizza is my 16th most visited place in New York! I then realized these data are far from perfect, for example when I saw that I only had 11 recorded visits to the studio where I went every workday to for almost 2 years.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the purposes of our case study, of whether to shop online or in person, I narrowed down the types of places to grocery stores, and they can be seen on the map here by number of visit.

            <p>
              Here I am trying to figure out what's the most likely trip I'm going to make next. I trained a small machine learning model on all of my trips recorded in the timeline data. Then I created an interactive map in the python notebook environment, where you can click to set the starting point of a trip, and it will predict the ending point of it. Here is a GIF of some examples. Soon it will be interactively available on this site as well.

              After looking at God's eye view maps of my experience shopping for groceries, I decided it would provide an interesting perspective to zoom in to the experience itself. I searched for `Food` and `Markets` on my Photo library, and created a collage on Photoshop of the images that resulted. I was surprised to find old friends, and even a long lost memory of walking into a shop to find the owner grinding a table while a patron held it in place. The isles of repeating color coordinated objects seem to be a staple of the experience.

            <h2>A Methods Manifesto</h2>
            <p>
              As Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren Klein assert in <b>Data Feminism</b>, “data are not neutral or objective.” The way they are collected tells a story. Approaching a particular data set with a specific question can skew our analysis. And regardless of what we intend, the data might simply take us somewhere else. In my explorations to answer the impossible, I allowed myself to be guided by the affordances the data and tools at hand offered. Embracing the unexpected led to wonderful insights about my own experience of the city—insights that would have eluded me if I had persisted in “finding proof” for my hypothesis. Therefore, I believe we should remain open to serendipitous encounters with our data as we explore it, and allow the answers to (re)formulate the questions.

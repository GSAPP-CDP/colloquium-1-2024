    <h2>Visualization Methods and Tools:</h2>
    <p>
        Matplotlib and Pandas: Utilized for creating static plots that effectively illustrate trends over time. These tools are ideal for displaying time series data, as seen in the graph showing the number of hotpot restaurants and their total area in NYC from 2014 to 2024.

        HTML and JavaScript Integration: By combining Pydeck with HTML and JavaScript, an interactive map was created. This map not only displays the locations of the hotpot restaurants but also allows for detailed exploration of each restaurant through interactive elements.

          Personalized smart chip for hot pot in the future:
        </h2>
        <p>
          The smart chip combines DNA analysis and brainwave recognition technology to provide customers with a highly personalized and convenient hot pot ordering experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          The chip can be embedded in wearable devices such as smart watches, rings, or even implanted in the skin to achieve real-time health monitoring and personalized recommendations.
        </p>
        <img src="Politics/Future1.jpg">

        <h2>
          Functions and implementations：DNA analysis module
        </h2>
        <p>
          Health data collection: The chip will regularly extract DNA from the user's blood or skin samples for comprehensive analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
          Personalized recommendations: Based on the results of DNA analysis, the system will recommend the most suitable hot pot ingredients and soup bases for users, such as low-salt and low-fat options, ingredients rich in specific vitamins, etc., to ensure that users meet their health needs every time they eat.
        </p>
        <img src="Politics/Future2.jpg">

        <h2>
          Functions and implementations：Brainwave recognition module
        </h2>
        <p>
          Emotion and demand sensing: The chip can monitor the user's brainwaves in real time and identify the user's emotional state and immediate needs. For example, if the user feels tired, the system will recommend energy-rich ingredients; if the user feels stressed, the system will recommend soothing ingredients.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thought-controlled ordering: Users can complete ordering through thoughts without any manual operation.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Hot pot ordering:
        </h2>
        <p>
          After the user sits down, the chip automatically starts to analyze his/her immediate health and emotional state.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on the analysis results, the system recommends personalized hot pot ingredients and soup base.
        </p>
        <p>
          The user confirms the order through thought, and the system will automatically complete the order.
        </p>
        <img src="Politics/Future4.jpg">

        <h2>
          Future Outlook：
        </h2>
        <p>
          This smart chip can not only be used for hot pot takeout, but can also be expanded to other types of catering services and health management.
        </p>
        <p>
          This concept creates a new personalized dining experience through the combination of DNA analysis and brain wave recognition technology.
